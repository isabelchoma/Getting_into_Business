#### Expanding Your Investment Knowledge

**Why would this dataset be useful?**

This dataset consists of the all-transactions house price index for Washington, US from 1975 to present. 
This dataset would be useful because the original dataset consists of data from Washington, US only from 2014. 

**How could it complement the data you are currently analyzing?**

We could use this dataset to compare the prices in that set to the trends of housing prices over the years.

**Provide a link to the additional dataset.**
